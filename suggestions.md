Suggestions for Enhancement

    Database Schema Optimization:
        Consider adding a user_id column to the transactions and goals tables to support multi-user functionality in the future, even if it’s out-of-scope for v1. This avoids schema migrations later.
        For the categories table, the type column’s CHECK constraint includes multiple options ('Income', 'Expense', etc.). Consider normalizing this into a separate category_types table to avoid hardcoding values and improve flexibility.
    API Endpoints:
        Add pagination and filtering to the /api/transactions GET endpoint (e.g., query parameters for date ranges, categories, or types) to improve performance with large datasets.
        Include an endpoint for bulk operations (e.g., /api/transactions/bulk for importing multiple transactions from CSV).
    Charts and Visualizations:
        For the home page’s bubble chart, ensure accessibility by providing alternative text or a table view for screen readers.
        For reports, consider adding a “download as PDF” feature for the charts to enhance usability.
    Security:
        Implement rate-limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse, especially for /api/data/import.
        Use parameterized queries in SQLAlchemy/Tortoise ORM to prevent SQL injection, even though FastAPI’s ORM usage typically mitigates this.
    File Structure:
        Add a config/ directory for environment variables (e.g., .env for database URLs, secret keys) to streamline configuration management.
        Include a scripts/ folder for utility scripts like the sample data population script.
    Testing:
        Expand the tests/ directory to include unit tests for models, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows (e.g., transaction CRUD, CSV import).
        Use pytest with pytest-asyncio for testing FastAPI’s async endpoints.
    Deployment:
        Consider using a cloud-based PostgreSQL service (e.g., AWS RDS, Supabase) for easier scaling and backup management.
        Add a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment to ensure code quality.
    Future Enhancements:
        For the AI/ML module, consider using simple linear regression or time-series models (e.g., ARIMA) for expense predictions, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn or statsmodels.
        Plan for progressive web app (PWA) features like offline support using service workers to align with the mobile-friendly goal.


#### Python functions:
#To reader format_money like amount:symbol, 4Rupees
```
def format_money(amount: float, currency_symbol: str) -> str:
    return f"{currency_symbol}{amount:,.2f}"
```
